        Ever wonder where the latin fonts come from? If you're
        like me the answer is no. Which is too bad;
        it's a surprisingly answerable question.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even more answerable though, is where did the design
        of capital letters come from? The answer to this is so simple, 
        I'm surprised I've never seen it occur in trivia.
    </p>

    <p>
        The answer: The inscription on 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan%27s_Column"> Trajan's column</a>.
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/21/Trajan_inscription_duotone.jpg" alt="Inscription on Trajan's column.">
    </p>

    <p>
        The impetus to ask this question came from my grandfather's technical
        drafting book "Engineering Drawing" by Thomas French. 
        Where, between French's illustrations of traditional lettering, French 
        explained - "all our fonts are based on 'Old Roman' ".
    </p>
        <emp>All</emp> our fonts? I'm a sucker for "universal beginnings" of this sort.
    </p>
    <p>
        But this article isn't about the history of fonts. It's about my
        attempts to understand a technique.
        A technique which, quietly, makes our lives a little bit better every day.
    </p>

    <h2>How do I make serifs?</h2>
    <p>
        My grandfather's old textbook found block lettering much more
        important to explain carefully. Leaving "Old Roman" to the 
        cartographers. But, there was a paragraph's worth of clues:
    </p>
    <img src="images/SerifsByFrench.jpg" 
    alt="Examples of how to draw serifs in Thomas French's 'Engineering Drawing' page 58.">
    <p>
        We have something old and something new.
        The proportions from the block letters were kept. 
        But there were at least two new major features, The directions
        of the stems were to have different thicknesses, and little plank
        things were added on all the horizontal and vertical lines.
    </p>
    <p>
        The image suggested to me that the "right" curve was to be
        connected from these planks to the stems. At this point though,
        I'm stuck. What exactly makes this curve "right"? Is it Because it's 
        "Old Roman"?
    </p>
    <p>
        What follows are my various guesses at how to make Serifs. 
        To my eyes, each of these techniques is beautiful and useful in its 
        own way; the journey is more important than the right curve.
    </p>

    <h2>Guess one: Euclidean ideal Serifs</h2>
    <p>
        I started on this journey because I'm curious about
        traditional drafting. The tech art of yesterday.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can only look at so many compass and straight
        edge constructions before you have the idea that
        a serif is just a corner of a circle.
    </p>
    <p>
        It turns out the planks and the stem are enough data to specify
        a circle. You think of the stem as a tangent line to the circle, and
        the plank as a tangent line, starting at the circle. 
    </p>
    <img src="images/Circle Serif construction.jpg" alt = "construction of circle serif.">
    <p>From now on,
        I'm going to refer the two ends of the plank, and the point of contact with
        the stem, as <emp>control points</emp>. The interactive image below,
        shows what the resulting serif looks like. Feel free to move the control points
        to match orientations shown in French's letter outlines.
    </p>
    <svg width = "30ex" height = "30ex" xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
        <path
            id = "arc path"
            d = "M63 , 21A121.05336734888178 , 121.05336734888178 0, 0, 1  182.0321551373176,143.01276297261796L183,23Z">
        </path>

        <circle
        id = "arc control point 1"
        class = "arcDraggable" 
        cx = "63" 
        cy = "21" 
        r = "5" >
    </circle>

    <circle 
        id = "arc control point 2"
        class = "arcDraggable"
        cx = "183"
        cy = "23"
        r = "5">
    </circle>

    <circle 
        id = "arc control point 3"
        class = "arcDraggable"
        cx = "182"
        cy = "147"
        r = "5">
    </circle>
    </svg>
    <p>You can drag the control points in the above image!</p>
    <h2>Guess two: hand painted Serifs</h2>
    <p>
        Geometrically constructed fonts were popular for centuries. Perhaps 
        The most notable examples are those by the famous artist
        <a href="https://library.reed.edu/special-collections/primary-source-sets/sets/letterforms/durer/index.html">
        Albrecht DÃ¼rer</a>. It was commonly believed that this was the approach
        used by the Romans for the Trajan Column's Inscription.
    </p>
    <p>
        It wasn't until the late 1960s that Edward M. Catich gave a 
        compelling argument in his book "The Origin of the Serif"
        that they were simply painted by hand.
    </p>
        <p>
        If you overlap the same letters, or interpoints on Trajan's Inscription
        you'll find they look different from each other in very human ways. 
        Suggesting stencils, or careful constructions, weren't used.
        </p>
        <p>
        For clear illustrations of this look up either Catich's text or 
        Tufte's "Visual Explanations" on page 96.
    </p>
    <p>
        For my purposes how it was done is less important than that it
        can be done this way. And we have contemporary examples of
        professionals that can paint Roman capitals with a broad side brush.

    <p>
        Notice how the artist makes the serifs much larger 
        than the stems by rotating his brush as he transitions.
        You can still get a feel for how serifs transition into stems
        even without the ability to rotate a brush. Try painting the 
        letter 'I' below in the paint program below it.
    </p>
        <div class="LargeLetter">I</div>
    <canvas id="letterPaintingExercise" width = "300" height = "300"></canvas>
    <input type="button"
        id = "refreshPaintingButton"
        value = "Refresh">
    <p>
        After trying quite a few times at this it's intuitive, that
        with practice, painting without constructions is practical.
    </p>
    <h2>Guess three: rotating the brush</h2>
    <p>Before I fully understood Catich's argument, I had a couple
        guesses over how exactly painting with the brush might work.
        In the previous guess, I wanted to make it clear that rotating
        the brush isn't essential to get a characteristic Serif shape.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because, after watching the pro work, I glibly thought rotating
        the brush was required. I confused myself even more horribly though!
        My guess for how to rotate this brush was even backwards from the pro!
    </p>
    <p>
        The following slider animation illustrates what I thought the surface
        of the brush was supposed to look like. I was very proud of myself,
        because the shape is pretty darn beautiful!
    </p>
    <canvas id="FixedWidthBrushStrokeSerif" width="300" height = "300"></canvas>
    <input type ="range"
    id = "SerifBrushProgression"
    min = "0"
    max = "300"
    value = "0"
    autocomplete="off">
    <p>
        Here is one of my attempts to do this with a pencil
        sharpened to have a long tip of exposed graphite. I moved
        my pencil over the paper in the same manner as the above
        animation.
    </p>
    <img src="images/contrasted pencil Serif illustration.jpg" alt="Pencil sketch of serif using a brush technique">
    <p>
        Those jumps in the lines of the animation aren't artificial, As one 
        line gets close to vertical (or horizontal) the other end speeds up 
        rapidly.
    </p>
    <h2>Guess four: Highschool doodles, or bezier Serifs</h2>
    <p>
        This guess is the reason why I decided to write up this article. 
        Because I had discovered that by slightly modifying the previous
        brush rotating technique, then we get a quadratic bezier curves.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead of having a fixed width brush, and rotating it along the control
        points of the Serif. Let the width of the brush line change, and allow the
        ends to linearly interpolate between their respective extremes.
    </p>
    <p>
        In high school, I would occasionally see students, bored with their
        lecture, doodle the following image in their note books.
    </p>
    <img src="images/Mysterious highschool doodle.jpg" 
    alt="Lines defined on a right angled corner, where for both ends of 
    the lines, an equal movement down one face of the corner, moves the 
    other point an equal distance down the other face of the corner">
    <p>
        Comparing these lines with the previous animation gave me a flash,
        of insight. I initially thought these were literally the same, they aren't; 
        but they're analogous! Rather than keep the length of the brush constant, 
        the sum of distances from the corner is constant instead.
    </p>
    <p> 
        What is true of both of them, is that you can imagine the "brush lines"
        moving through space, and this was enough for make me see that I 
        was looking at the spine of De Casteljau's algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
        Freya has a wonderful discussion of Bezier curves broadly, with a 
        particularly nice animation of De Casteljau's algorithm on Quadratic 
        Bezier curves.
    </p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aVwxzDHniEw?t=145" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    
    <p>
        In the classic construction of De Casteljau's algorithm, 
        you construct the curve by plotting the midpoint of the "brush line".
        But I had an idea - if I wanted to draw a bezier curve with the broad
        side of a long sharped pencil. I could fake shortening the pencil by
        overshooting the stem control points. The excess would be filled in 
        by the stem anyway.
    </p>
    <img src="images/broad edge pencil example.jpg" 
    alt="image showing how to shorten effective pencil length by drawing into stem">
    <p>The serif that this would draw, would be the serif you'd obtain from the 
        highschool doodle, if you drew so many lines you couldn't see the individual
        lines anymore. Is the curve of that serif really the same as the quadratic bezier
        curve given by De Casteljau's algorithm?
    </p>
    <p>
        The answer is yes, for a beautifully simple reason.
        The "brush line" of De Casteljau's algorithm is the 
        derivative of the bezier curve. And because the graph of
        quadratics are convex, any tangent line (or derivative line) must
        lie entirely one one side. 
    </p>
    <p>The tangent lines will never invade the region on the other side,
        of the bezier curve, and each one contains a point of the bezier curve,
        by definition of its construction.
    </p>
    <p>
        I invite you to prove that the line between lines of De Casteljau's
        algorithm is indeed the derivative at the point it's constructing.
        It's a satisfyingly simple argument.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below is what this serif would look like. This is perhaps the easiest 
        serif to construct on a computer.
    </p>
    <svg width = "30ex" height = "30ex" xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
        <path
            id = "bezier path"
            d = "M 10, 10 Q 50, 10 50, 50 L 50, 10 Z">
        </path>

        <circle
            id = "bezier control point 1"
            class = "bezierDraggable" 
            cx = "10" 
            cy = "10" 
            r = "5" >
        </circle>

        <circle 
            id = "bezier control point 2"
            class = "bezierDraggable"
            cx = "50"
            cy = "10"
            r = "5">
        </circle>

        <circle 
            id = "bezier control point 3"
            class = "bezierDraggable"
            cx = "50"
            cy = "50"
            r = "5">
        </circle>
    </svg>
    <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
    <p>
        None of the more technical constructions really match exactly how 
        the Romans made their Serifs. However, in them I see a clear
        statement and identity. They embody the beauty of simple patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
        Though even though mathematics is beautiful, it isn't the only beauty
        there is clearly room in these letters to express something more individual
        more subjective, and you see calligraphers do this all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
        In either case, we have technology to support our choice - we have no 
        limits here. I am happy to call any of the above techniques correct. I hope
        you enjoyed this journey as much as I did.
